> _‘Wait — Bogrod!’_

> Another goblin came scurrying around the counter.

> _‘We have instructions,’_ he said, with a bow to  
Hermione, _‘forgive me, Madam, but there have  
been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.’_

> He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the  
Imperiused goblin shook him off.

> _‘I am aware of the instructions. Madam Lestrange  
wishes to visit her vault. ... very old family ... old  
clients ... this way, please ...’_
